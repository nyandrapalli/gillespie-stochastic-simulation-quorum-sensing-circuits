# Gillespie Quorum-Sensing Simulation Analysis

This repository packages the artefacts generated while characterising quorum-sensing circuits with Gillespie stochastic simulations. The current data set reflects the plasmid-based models described below and the rerun timelapse/sweep experiments for Cond1–Cond4.

## Circuit Conditions

- **Cond1** – Single cell carrying pCon–luxI, pCon–luxR, and pLux–GFP plasmids (default 10 copies each).
- **Cond2** – AHL producer cell (pCon–luxI plasmid) coupled to a responder cell that contains pCon–luxR and pLux–GFP plasmids.
- **Cond3** – Two-cell Lux/Las cross-talk: cell A hosts pCon–luxI, pCon–lasR, and pLas–GFP plasmids; cell B hosts pCon–luxR, pLux–GFP, and pLux–lasI plasmids.
- **Cond4** – Single cell containing the full plasmid complement from Cond3 (pCon–luxI, pCon–lasR, pCon–luxR, pLas–GFP, pLux–GFP, pLux–lasI).

All plasmid copy numbers are fixed at 10 in the sweep studies. For timelapse trails we repeated each condition at copy numbers {5, 10, 20, 40} per plasmid type.

## Repository Layout

- `data/Cond*/summary_cond*.csv` – 500-replicate sweep summaries over RNAP totals {20, 35, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200} and ribosome totals {50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500} with plasmid copy number = 10. Columns include mean GFP, SD, CV, and CV² evaluated over t = 2500–3000.
- `data/trails/copies_*/Cond*/` – Timelapse outputs for each plasmid-copy scenario: summary CSV, mean-curve CSV, and timelapse plot PNG. Raw trajectories (≈10–20 MB each) remain outside version control.
- `plots/` – Pre-rendered sweep visualisations (heatmaps, contour maps, 3D surfaces, and line comparisons) generated by `analyze_sweeps.py` for Cond1–Cond4.
- `scripts/` – Simulation drivers:
  - `cond*_timelapse.py` – Gillespie simulators with a `--copies` flag for plasmid copy number (default 10).
  - `cond*_sweep.py` – Resource sweeps that keep plasmid copy numbers fixed at 10.
- `analyze_sweeps.py` – Plotting utility that consumes the sweep summaries and regenerates the figures in `plots/`.

## Reproducing the Plots

```bash
python analyze_sweeps.py
```

Optional flags let you point at alternate data/plot directories or change the ribosome slice used for the cross-condition comparison:

```bash
python analyze_sweeps.py --data path/to/data --plots path/to/output --ribo 300
```

## Re-running the Simulations

- **Timelapse trails:**
  ```bash
  python scripts/cond1_timelapse.py -N 500 --copies 20 --out runs/cond1_copies20
  ```
  Use the `--copies` flag to sweep plasmid copy numbers. Adjust `-N`, `--T`, and window arguments as needed.

- **Resource sweeps:**
  ```bash
  python scripts/cond3_sweep.py --RNAP 20 50 100 --Ribo 50 200 400 --out runs/cond3_sweep_subset
  ```
  Sweeps assume 10 plasmid copies per type; customise the RNAP/Ribo grids, replicate count `-N`, and runtime `--T` as required.

### Raw Timelapse Trajectories

Full per-replicate timelapse matrices are large and left in the working folders (`Trails_plasmid/copies_*/Cond*/cond*_timelapse_raw.csv`). Regenerate them by re-running the timelapse scripts before post-processing with the supplied utilities.
