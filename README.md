# gillespie-stochastic-simulation-quorum-sensing-circuits
Tools and datasets for analysing quorum-sensing circuits with Gillespie stochastic simulations. Includes Lux/Lux–Las timelapse runs (Trails 1–3), large RNAP/Ribo resource sweeps for Cond1–Cond3, the underlying simulation scripts, and plotting utilities that turn summary CSVs into heatmaps, surfaces, and comparative line views.
